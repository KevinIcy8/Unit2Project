LinearEquation class

Instance variable:
    private int x1
    private int y1
    private int x2
    private int y2



Constructor
public LinearEquation (int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
    this will be my constructor for all the coordinate pairs that my user types in


Initialize all the private variables to the variables in the parameter

Methods

public double calculateSlope()
this will calculate and store the slope

public void calculateSlope()
this will print the slope

public void distance()
this will calculate and print the distance

public double calYIntercept()
this will calculate and store the yIntercept

public void getYIntercept()
this will print the yIntercept

public void slopeIntForm()
this will print out all the info in a y = mx+b form.

public void getCalY(double newX)  //newX being the user input for x
this will calculate and print the y coordinate corresponding to x coordinate

Organization:
have the slope become a fraction
round y intercept and distance to the nearest hundredth
comments for readability

EquationRunner.java
Step 1. ask user for the first coordinate pair
Step 2. ask user for the second coordinate pair
Step 3. print out the first coordinate pair
Step 4. print out the second coordinate pair
Step 5. call getSlope to print slope of line
Step 6. call getYIntercept to print y intercept of line
Step 7. call getDistance to print the distance
Step 8. call the slopeIntForm to print the equation in y=mx+b form
Step 9. ask user for a new x coordinate
Step 10. call getCalY to prints out the coordinate pair with the solved y coordinate
