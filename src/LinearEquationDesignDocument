LinearEquation class

Instance variable:
    private int x1
    private int y1
    private int x2
    private int y2
    private newX

Constructor
public LinearEquation (int x, int y)
    this will be my constructor for when my user type in the coordinate pairs
public LinearEquation (int newX)
    this will be my constructor for when the user enter only the x coordinate

Initialize all the private variables to the variables in the parameter

Methods

public double slope
this will calculate the slope

public double distance
this will calculate the distance

public double yIntercept
this will find the yIntercept

public void formulaConstructor
this will print out all the info in a y = mx+b form.

public void yCalculator
this will calculate the y coordinate of the corresponding x coordinate

Optimization:
have the slope become a fraction
round y intercept and distance to the nearest hundredth


EquationRunner.java
Step 1. ask user for the first coordinate pair
Step 2. ask user for the second coordinate pair
Step 3. print out the first coordinate pair
Step 4. print out the second coordinate pair
Step 5. call the formulaConstructor to print the equation in y=mx+b form
Step 6. call slope to print slope of line (m)
Step 7. call yIntercept to print y intercept of line (b)
Step 8. call the distance to print the distance
Step 9. ask user for a new x coordinate
Step 10. call yCalculator to prints out the coordinate pair with the correct formation
